= PGroonga â€“ Make PostgreSQL fast full text search platform for all languages!

PostgreSQL has built-in full text search feature. But it supports only limited languages. For example, it doesn't support Japanese. pg_trgm bundled in PostgreSQL supports all languages including Japanese. But it has performance problems for large documents.

This talk describes about PGroonga that resolves these problems.
